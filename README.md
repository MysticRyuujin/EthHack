# EthHack
Brute Force Ethereum Addresses with Python or PowerShell

NOTE: The PowerShell/.NET Nethereum version is like 60x faster on my machine than the Python version...

NOTE: The probability of actually finding an account with a balance is so astronimically small that running this is a complete and total waste of time, engery, and effort. You're more likely to win the lottery 10 times (or something stupid like that)

# Optimize-Peers
This script is designed to loop through all of the peers connected to multiple nodes and disconnect redundant peers. I use this script to ensure maximum connectivity and communication effeciency between my local nodes and exteranl peers.
